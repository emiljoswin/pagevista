This was a fun project that I had started about a year ago and it is incomplete. However, it was one  of my favorites because
it is through this project that i got into the world of web development. In fact, it was here that I wrote my first html, css and javascript. I
knew a bit of python beforehand. From there it went onto google app-engine, memcached etc. Things moved on quickly. I learned a lot in the past 
one year and now I spend a significant portion of my time developing backend architectures for websites as well as mobile devices.

This is a website that will provide you with a personal homepage. 

If all you want to do is write something online and share it with people in a simple, straight-forward manner, then  
http://pagevista.appspot.com/welcome is the place for you. You are provided a bit of free land on the internet. Write what you want just like the way you write in your notepad, click "upload" button and your post goes public !

People can comment on your post as well as like/dislike them. I remember implementing a 'follow a writer' feature which I decided to not show on 
the front-end as I was confused as to how and where I must put them. :)
